# Python-Assignment-1
# Python Programs: Basic Operations and Greeting Generator

This repository contains two simple Python programs:

## 1. `file1.py` – Basic Arithmetic Operations

This script prompts the user to input two numbers and performs the following arithmetic operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with handling for division by zero)

### How It Works
- The user is prompted to enter two numbers.
- These values are converted to floats and passed to the `basic_operations` function.
- The script calculates and displays the results of the operations.
- If invalid input is provided (non-numeric), it displays an appropriate error message.

## 2. `file2.py` – Personalized Greeting

This script collects the user's first and last name, combines them, and prints a personalized greeting.

### How It Works
- The user is prompted to input their first and last name.
- The script concatenates the names into a full name.
- A greeting message is then displayed using the full name.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Running the Programs

To run either script, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python file1.py
